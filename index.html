              An early night might sound nice, but don't force sleep. Heading to
              bed before you're tired may lead to sleep anxiety and insomnia.

              Hyperarousal (an active or 'busy' mind) is the main reason people
              with insomnia can't sleep. Make time to switch off before bed.

              A quiet and dark room is essential for a good night's sleep. Light
              exposure and noise can interfere with sleep quantity and quality.

            <dd>
              Leave work at your desk and meals in the kitchen. Your brain
              should only associate bed with sleep and intimate activities.

              Unplug at night. Blue light delays the release of sleep-inducing
              melatonin, increases alertness, and sets back your internal sleep
              clock.
